# Mini Bank API Overview

## 1. Core Features

### a. User Management
- **User Registration**: Allow users to create accounts with details such as name, email, password, and phone number.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure login with JWT tokens for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.
- **Password Management**: Include features like password reset, password hashing (using libraries like BCrypt), and email verification.

### b. Account Management
- **Create Bank Accounts**: Allow users to open different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
- **Account Details**: Provide endpoints for users to view their balance, recent transactions, and account status.
- **Account Locking/Unlocking**: Implement account suspension/activation based on user actions or system decisions.

### c. Transactions
- **Deposit**: Allow users to deposit funds into their accounts.
- **Withdrawal**: Implement secure withdrawals, ensuring that sufficient funds are available.
- **Fund Transfer**: Provide internal transfers between user accounts and external transfers (e.g., sending money to another userâ€™s account).
- **Transaction History**: Allow users to view their transaction history with details such as date, amount, and type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).

### d. Card Management (Optional)
- **Virtual Card Creation**: Allow users to create virtual debit cards linked to their bank accounts.
- **Card Blocking/Unblocking**: Add features for users to block or unblock their cards.
- **Spending Limits**: Implement daily or monthly spending limits for cards.

### e. Notifications
- **Email/SMS Alerts**: Notify users of important actions like large transactions, account changes, or login attempts.
- **Push Notifications (Optional)**: Implement push notifications via services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for mobile apps.

### f. Admin Dashboard
- **User and Account Monitoring**: Provide admin features to monitor user activities, account statuses, and large transactions.
- **Transaction Approvals**: Add a feature where certain high-value transactions must be manually approved by an admin.
- **Audit Logs**: Record every significant action for auditing and compliance.

## 2. Security Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security with a second layer of authentication, like an OTP sent via SMS or email.
- **Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS for securing communication between the API and clients. Store sensitive data like passwords using secure encryption techniques.
- **Anti-fraud Measures**: Implement detection for suspicious activities like large withdrawals or transfers, unusual login locations, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a given timeframe.

## 3. Database Design (PostgreSQL)
- **Users Table**: Store user details (e.g., email, hashed password, role).
- **Accounts Table**: Store bank account information (e.g., user_id, account_number, account_type, balance).
- **Transactions Table**: Record every financial transaction (e.g., account_id, amount, type, status, timestamp).
- **Cards Table (Optional)**: If you implement card features, this will store virtual card details (e.g., card_number, expiration_date, account_id).
- **Audit Logs Table**: Record admin or system activities for auditing purposes.

## 4. Technical Recommendations

### a. Kotlin + Spring Boot
- **Kotlin**: Concise and expressive code.
- **Spring Boot**: Rapid development and production-ready features.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with PostgreSQL.

### b. Database (PostgreSQL)
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable and scalable.
- **Liquibase/Flyway**: For database migrations.

### c. API Documentation
- **Springdoc OpenAPI**: Automatically generate API documentation.

### d. Testing
- **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**: For unit and integration tests.

### e. Error Handling
- **@ControllerAdvice**: Global exception handling.

### f. Data Validation
- **Hibernate Validator**: For input data validation.

## 5. External Services
- **Email Sending**: SendGrid or Mailgun.
- **SMS Sending**: Twilio or Nexmo.
- **Payment Gateway (Optional)**: Stripe or PayPal.

## 6. DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerize the application.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Kubernetes (Optional)**: For container orchestration.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: For application monitoring.
- **Centralized Logging**: ELK Stack or cloud logging services.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus and Grafana.
